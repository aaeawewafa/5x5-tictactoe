rules


Objective

・Be the first to get 4 of your pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Board

・The game uses a 5×5 grid.

・Each player takes turns placing one piece per turn.

・Two players:

　　Player: X

　　AI: O

First or Second

・Before the game starts, the player chooses to go first (X) or second (O).

・The AI automatically takes the opposite role.

・The player who goes first always starts the game.

Winning

・The first player to align 4 pieces in a row wins.

・The winning line is highlighted in light green for clarity.

Full Board Reset

・If the board becomes completely full without a winner, it is reset to empty automatically.

・This ensures the game can continue without long stalemates.

Turn Order

・Players alternate turns starting with the chosen first player.

・Only one piece may be placed per turn in an empty cell.

AI

・The AI uses a depth-limited minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

・It plays strategically but is not perfect, keeping the game challenging yet fair.


Strategy Tips

・Try to create multiple threats simultaneously to force the AI to defend.

・Watch the board for potential AI winning lines and block them.

・Since the board resets when full, plan sequences that can survive through multiple resets.
